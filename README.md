👋 Hi, I’m Fernando and my nickname is a joke with my name and the NAND gate output (1, 1, 1, 0) ... so fer + 1110 = "Fernand". I decided to supress the letter 'O' just to make it easier.


🤓 I’m currently learning ReactJS, NodeJS and Typescript, and I intend to also learn Python A.S.A.P. in order to build some data science projects.
